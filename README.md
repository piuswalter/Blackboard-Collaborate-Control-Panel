# Blackboard Collaborate Control Panel

The Blackboard Collaborate Control Panel (BCCP) provides a variety of directly accessible functions and extensions for the Distance Learning System Blackboard Collaborate.

## How to use BCCP

The use of BCCP is simple. To use BCCP with a running Blackboard Collaborate instance, all you have to do is import the file `bccp.js` via the JavaScript console of your browser. After that the BCCP is shown. To load the source code, it is sufficient to insert the following into the JavaScript console.

```javascript
$.getScript('https://piuswalter.github.io/Blackboard-Collaborate-Control-Panel/dist/bccp.js');
```

Afterwards all functions are available.

If you like to use the Dark Mode in BCCP just click the big upper label with 'Blackboard Collaborate Control Panel'.

To close BCCP just click the '&times;' in the upper right corner.
