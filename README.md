# Blackboard Collaborate Control Panel

The Blackboard Collaborate Control Panel (BCCP) provides a variety of directly accessible functions and extensions for the Distance Learning System Blackboard Collaborate.


## How to use BCCP

The use of BCCP is simple. To use BCCP with a running Blackboard Collaborate instance, all you have to do is import the file `injection.js` via the JavaScript console of your browser. After that the BCCP is shown. To load the source code, it is sufficient to insert the following into the JavaScript console.

```javascript
$.getScript('https://piuswalter.github.io/Blackboard-Collaborate-Control-Panel/injection.js');
```

Afterwards all functions are available. To close BCCP just click the '&times;' in the upper right corner.
